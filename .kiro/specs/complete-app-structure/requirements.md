# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the completion of the Next.js 15 enterprise application structure, focusing on implementing the remaining core features including App Router structure, Server Actions, state management, authentication components, and internationalization. The goal is to transform the current basic setup into a fully functional enterprise-grade application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: App Router Structure Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete App Router structure with internationalization support, so that the application can handle multiple languages and provide proper routing for all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the root URL THEN the system SHALL redirect to the default locale (en)
2. WHEN accessing a locale-specific URL THEN the system SHALL render the appropriate localized content
3. WHEN accessing protected routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
4. WHEN an error occurs on any page THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error boundaries
5. WHEN a page is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading states
6. WHEN accessing a non-existent route THEN the system SHALL display a 404 page
7. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain proper SEO metadata

### Requirement 2: Server Actions Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication and user management functionality, so that I can register, login, logout, and manage my profile safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and create a session
2. WHEN registering a new account THEN the system SHALL validate data and create a new user
3. WHEN logging out THEN the system SHALL clear the session and redirect appropriately
4. WHEN updating profile information THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes
5. WHEN changing password THEN the system SHALL verify current password and update securely
6. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
7. WHEN server actions complete THEN the system SHALL provide user feedback

### Requirement 3: State Management Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized state management using Zustand, so that application state is consistent and easily manageable across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user authentication state changes THEN all components SHALL reflect the updated state
2. WHEN UI preferences are modified THEN the changes SHALL persist across sessions
3. WHEN user data is updated THEN the state SHALL synchronize with the server
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the error state SHALL be properly managed
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the state SHALL be initialized from persistent storage
6. WHEN state updates occur THEN only relevant components SHALL re-render

### Requirement 4: Authentication Components Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive and responsive authentication forms, so that I can easily register, login, and manage my account with a great user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing authentication forms THEN they SHALL be responsive and accessible
2. WHEN entering form data THEN real-time validation SHALL provide immediate feedback
3. WHEN submitting forms THEN loading states SHALL indicate processing
4. WHEN form submission succeeds THEN users SHALL be redirected appropriately
5. WHEN form submission fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed
6. WHEN using animations THEN they SHALL enhance user experience without hindering performance
7. WHEN switching between login and register THEN the transition SHALL be smooth

### Requirement 5: Internationalization Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to support multiple languages (English and Chinese), so that I can use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a language THEN all UI text SHALL display in the chosen language
2. WHEN switching languages THEN the URL SHALL reflect the language change
3. WHEN accessing the application THEN the default language SHALL be detected from browser preferences
4. WHEN translating content THEN formatting and layout SHALL remain consistent
5. WHEN adding new text content THEN translation keys SHALL be properly structured
6. WHEN the application loads THEN the correct language bundle SHALL be loaded efficiently
7. WHEN SEO crawlers access pages THEN proper hreflang tags SHALL be present

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when errors occur or content is loading, so that I understand the application state and can take appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are loading THEN appropriate loading indicators SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN errors occur THEN user-friendly error messages SHALL be shown
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN retry options SHALL be available
4. WHEN form validation fails THEN field-specific errors SHALL be highlighted
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN error boundaries SHALL prevent application crashes
6. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the UI SHALL return to normal state
7. WHEN loading states change THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and informative

### Requirement 7: Navigation and Layout

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation and layout throughout the application, so that I can easily move between different sections and understand the application structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating the application THEN the header SHALL remain consistent across pages
2. WHEN accessing different sections THEN the active navigation item SHALL be highlighted
3. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the navigation SHALL be responsive and touch-friendly
4. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN appropriate navigation options SHALL be available
5. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN only public navigation options SHALL be shown
6. WHEN page transitions occur THEN they SHALL be smooth and maintain context
7. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible

### Requirement 8: Performance and SEO

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want the application to perform well and be discoverable by search engines, so that users have a fast experience and the application can be found online.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN they SHALL achieve good Core Web Vitals scores
2. WHEN content is rendered THEN it SHALL be server-side rendered for SEO
3. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL be optimized and lazy-loaded
4. WHEN JavaScript bundles are loaded THEN they SHALL be code-split appropriately
5. WHEN search engines crawl THEN proper meta tags and structured data SHALL be present
6. WHEN users navigate THEN subsequent page loads SHALL be fast due to prefetching
7. WHEN the application is audited THEN it SHALL meet accessibility standards
